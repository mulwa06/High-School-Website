    <blockquote class="one"> 
        
        The life of a <span class="bold1"> man</span>  is determined by his experience, his adventures, his wins and his failures. 
        As a Mangu Man every one showered their praises to you. So it was up to you to live upto their expectations and achieve even greater. 
        However, this might be a really big responsibility for one individual to bear all by himself. 
        Considering the shifting dynamics of the world from the way people used to look upto the man as the only primal source of living for a family to our current society which embraces single parents.
        I can firmly say that men are no longer defined by their sexuality anymore.
   
    </blockquote>


    <blockquote class="two">So who is the current Man?
        What is his current role in society rather than just earning chunks of money to provide for his family?
        Well I believe his role is to embrace change in the world and make it better. 
        Accepting the differences that everyone has and embracing the differences to make the world a better place. 
        Living with different people in school, all from different cultures and being able to co-relate with each other in living harmoniously, is the discipline required to drive humanity forwards.
        And that is his role in society.
