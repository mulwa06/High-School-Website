    <blockquote class="three"> Being part of the great society of Mangu High School, I studied in the period 2017-2021. Yeah, I was there in 2020 during the crisis, during the havoc reign of a pandemic that we all suffered.
        I have never had a much enjoyable time in my academic life than in this prestigious school. 
        Despite the many rules, the unrealistic beef that existed between every form in the school, it was still home,and we all fought for one thing; our excellence.
        I had many experiences I'm not even sure where to begin.
        The most important thing is that we all stuck with each other. We all had each others backs in tough times, in ugly times and in fun times. Mangu men, as we would call ourselves, thrived on each other's success rather than failure.
        During sporting events we would rally up and support the sports men singing chants that lifted the sportsmen's spirits even in daring times when we saw no hope.
        It was all down to team effort and everyone had to play their part. I remember how during my first week in the school, I felt disturbed at how much the school captains would
        always ask us which sport I was in or which co-curricuum was I planning to join. I never had the answer so I said I would I would think about it. However, stating that I would not
        join any club or sport was treted as a crime and one that would be punished severely by the school captains themselves. And while you might think that the punishments they gave was just some washing to do...well, you are dead wrong!
        It was far much worse and no one would dare even try to coss the captains' words. But that's a story for another time.
